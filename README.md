# CountdownWidgetApp (GitHub-ready)
This project is prepared to be uploaded to a GitHub repository root.
Steps to use:
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload **all files and folders inside this project root** (not the outer folder).
2. Push to remote. In GitHub, go to **Actions -> Android Release (build via Gradle Action)** and run the workflow, or push a tag like `v1.0`.
3. When the workflow finishes, open the workflow run and download the APK from **Artifacts**, or check the created Release.
